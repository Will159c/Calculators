# Matrix Calculator

A desktop-based Java application that performs various matrix operations, including:

- Matrix Addition
- Matrix Subtraction
- Matrix Multiplication
- Row Reduction to RREF (Reduced Row Echelon Form)

Built as the final project for Linear Algebra (Spring 2024). Earned a 100% grade.

## 🧠 Features

- Interactive GUI built with Java Swing
- Fully functional matrix input system
- Handles basic and advanced operations (like RREF)
- Input validation to prevent calculation errors
- Computes operations based on the position of the matrices

---

## 🚀 Planned Features

- Autofill buttons for quick input (identity, zero, random matrices)
- Support for more matrix operations (e.g., inverse, determinant)
- Add physics-related functionality (e.g., vectors, transformations)
